To build the docker image launch the command

- docker build -t most_demo -f Dockerfile .

To launch the container use the command

- docker run -it  -p 2000:2000 -p 3306:3306 -p 3478:3478 -p 5060:5060 -p 8000:8000 --name most_container most_demo

The first time you launch the container run in the container the command

- init_django.sh

Finally to launch the server use the command

- run.sh <ip_address>

The ip_address should be the external address of the server since it needs to be accessible by the tablet and phone devices.
