To build the docker image launch the command

- docker build -t most_demo -f Dockerfile .

To launch the container use the command

- docker run -it --net=host -v <path/to/most-demo/git/repository>:/tmp/most-demo  --name <name_of_the_container> most_demo

The first time you launch the container run in the container the command

- init_django.sh

Finally to launch the server use the command

- run.sh <ip_address>

The ip_address should be the external address of the server since it needs to be accessible by the tablet and phone devices.
