MOST
====

The  MOST (Moving research Outcomes to Standard Telemedicine practice) project aims to achieve an open,
modular and scalable solution for the creation, execution and management of remote clinical consultations with direct
interaction between specialists.

The project consists of a set of frameworks that deal with different aspects and technologies useful for the creation of telemedicine applications.

In addition to the frameworks, the project contains a number of helper modules, that should ease developers to build telemedicine applications focusing only on high value-added functionality.
